    <h1>Èö±ÁßÅÊ¨äÊîøÁ≠ñ Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> August 1, 2025</p>
    <p>This Privacy Policy provided by <strong>ÈôΩÊòéË≥áË®äËÇ°‰ªΩÊúâÈôêÂÖ¨Âè∏, YANG MING TEK COMPUTER INC.</strong> (hereinafter ‚Äúwe‚Äù, ‚Äúus‚Äù, or ‚Äúour‚Äù), applies to and explains how the mobile application <strong>ÈÜ´Â∏´Ë°åÂãïÂ∑°Êàø</strong> (hereinafter ‚ÄúApp‚Äù) collects, uses, and protects information in connection with your use.</p>

    <h2>About This App</h2>
    <p>This App is intended for use by a limited group of authorized users. User accounts are created and managed by the user‚Äôs own organization. The App functions as a secure tool to access and display data from that organization‚Äôs systems.</p>
    <p>We do not offer account registration through the App.</p>

    <h2>Information We Handle</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Sign-in:</strong> We process login credentials provided by your organization only for authentication.</li>
        <li><strong>Displayed data:</strong> The App shows data that is already accessible via your organization‚Äôs account system. We do not store, cache, or alter this data on our own servers.</li>
        <li><strong>Automatically collected:</strong> Basic technical data (device type, operating system, crash logs) may be collected to ensure functionality and improve stability. This data is used only for technical purposes and is not used to personally identify you. We do not collect analytics or personal usage data within the App. Crash reporting data is limited to technical details and does not include personal identifiers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
    <p>We use information only to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Authenticate users through their organization‚Äôs system.</li>
        <li>Provide access to and display organizational data.</li>
        <li>Maintain security and improve the performance of the App.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not use your data for advertising or marketing.</p>

    <h2>Sharing of Information</h2>
    <p>We do not sell or share user data with third parties for marketing or advertising purposes. Information may only be shared:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>With service providers who perform services on our behalf, such as cloud hosting providers or crash reporting services. These providers are obligated to protect the information and use it only for the purposes for which we disclose it to them.</li>
        <li>As required by law or legal process, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of our company, our users, or others.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Retention</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Login information is processed only during authentication and is not retained by us.</li>
        <li>Technical logs (e.g. crash reports) may be kept for up to 24 months for troubleshooting.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Children‚Äôs Privacy</h2>
    <p>The App is intended for professional use and is not directed at children. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under the age of 13 (or under 16 in some jurisdictions). If you believe we have inadvertently collected such data, please contact us immediately.</p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>We apply a combination of technical, administrative, and physical security measures to protect the information we handle. This includes, but is not limited to, using secure connections (e.g., HTTPS) for data transmission between your device and your organization's systems. However, no system can be guaranteed 100% secure.</p>

    <h2>Changes</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make material changes, we will notify users through the App or through the user's organization. The latest version will always be available on our website.</p>
